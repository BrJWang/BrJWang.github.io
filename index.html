                     I'm Braden Wang — a junior mechanical engineering with a passion for robotics, hands-on design, and solving real-world problems. 
                     <br>This site is a collection of my work from school, clubs, and independent projects, showcasing how I turn ideas into tangible, 
                     <br>functional systems. Whether it's designing precision mechanisms, building robots from the ground up, or experimenting with 
                     <br>unorthodox designs, I thrive at the intersection of theory and application. Each project here highlights not only technical 
                     <br>outcomes but the process, challenges, and lessons learned along the way.
                     <br>
                     <br>Thanks for stopping by — I invite you to explore the projects that define my journey so far.

                  <p>
                     This website is, and will be, for projects that I've made in my own interest. Some have questionable levels of function,
                     <br> maybe even no practical use at all. However, that's just the point. Making things
                     <br> for myself is liberating, and being free from any creative restriction allows me to push my own technical boundaries further 
                     <br> than when I make things for a class, club or event. These such projects have been seen by very few, and have contributed very
                     <br> little to my reputation as a student, yet contributed the most to my own ability to design and manufacture.
                     <br>
