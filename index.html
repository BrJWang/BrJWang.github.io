                     My name is Braden Wang, a sophomore currently enrolled as a Mechanical Engineer at the University of California, Berkeley. 
                     <br> I really like making stuff, and have always been part of some club involved in making robots, cars, etc. I've participated 
                     <br>in science fairs, ranked highly in hackathons, and otherwise went out of my way to make things for other people.

                  <h1>What is this website?</h1>
                  <p>
                     This website is, and will be, for projects that I've made in my own interest. They will often have questionable levels of function,
                     <br> and maybe no practical use at all. However, that's just the point. It was only recently that I discovered that making things
                     <br> for myself is liberating, and being free from any creative restriction allows me to push my own technical boundaries further 
                     <br> than when I make things for a class, club or event. These such projects have been seen by very few, and have contributed very
                     <br> little to my reputation as a student, yet contributed the most to my own ability to design and manufacture.
