                    <p>
                        For my Mechanical Engineering senior design project, I decided to make something focused on helping the people, while also challenging myself through unfamiliar territory. My group of four settled on making a self-stabilizing spoon aimed at canceling out hand tremors associated with Parkinson's disease. Similar products exist on the market, but are usually oddly shaped. Our goal was to make the device fit within a form factor similar to that of an electric toothbrush, which would lessen the learning curve and make it look more "normal" to use.
