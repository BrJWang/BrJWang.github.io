                            Calsol, or the UC Berkeley Solar Vehicle Team, is a team of undergraduate engineers who build solar-powered vehicles to compete in various national competitions like the Formula Sun Grand Prix and the American Solar Challenge. We make a new vehicle every 2 years, and are currently designing the 11th generation vehicle set to race in the Summer of 2026.

                            In the Summer of 2025, my team and I flew out to Kentucky to compete in the Formula Sun Grand Prix. Before the race began I helped make emergency adjustments to the diameter of the centerlock pins, set up telecommunications equipment, and supervise the car as it went through inspections. During the race itself I worked with a large pit crew to make swift tire pressure checks, water bladder changes, and on-the-fly diagnosis of worrying sounds coming from the vehicle. As a team we came together to diagnose a knocking issue using what we knew about the geometry of the car and what little feedback the driver could radio us about, and were able to pinpoint the issue to a faulty trailing arm on the next pitstop which we were able to replace.
