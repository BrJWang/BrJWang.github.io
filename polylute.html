                        The Polylute is a fictional instrument; a corrupted item brought into reality. Originating from the Risk of Rain 2 videogame, the Polylute in-game is a guitar with extra necks and strings growing in odd directions. In order to bring about some variety and practicality, I transformed the main body into a shortform bass, while making the protruding instruments into a shortform guitar and ukulele. This meant I needed to be very thorough with adding additional reinforcing ribs in the main guitar body since the body needed to now withstand higher string tensions while also having gaping holes cut into it meant to house the other two instruments. The end result was a fully functioning acoustic-electric amalgamation of a bass, guitar and ukulele which could be plugged into an amp.
